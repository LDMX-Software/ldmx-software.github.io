# What the F.A.Q.?
Frequent issues and potholes that new collaborators run into while starting their work with LDMX software.

### Is it okay for me to use tools outside the container? I have been informed to only use the container when working on LDMX.
The container is focused on being a well-defined and well-tested environment for ldmx-sw, but it may not be able to accomodate every aspect of your workflow. For example, my specific workflow can be outlined with the following commands (not a tutorial, just an outline for explanatory purposes):

```
ldmx cmake .. # configure ldmx-sw build
ldmx make install # build and install ldmx-sw
ldmx fire sim.py # run a simulation
rootbrowse sim_output.root #look at simulation file with local ROOT build **outside the container**
ldmx fire analysis.py sim_output.root #analyze the simulation file
python pretty_plotter.py histogram.root #make PDFs from ROOT histograms generated by analysis.py
```

As you can see, I switch between inside the container and outside the container and I can do this because I have an install of ROOT outside the container. Key point: For what I am doing which is simply looking at ROOT files and plotting ROOT histograms, my ROOT install does not need to match the ROOT inside the container.
I think using both the container and a local installation of ROOT is a very powerful combination. This allows for you to use ROOT's TBrowser or TTreeViewer to debug files while using the container to actually build and run ldmx-sw.
Another workflow that follows a similar protocol is a python-based analysis.

```
ldmx cmake .. # configure ldmx-sw build
ldmx make install # build and install ldmx-sw
ldmx fire sim.py # run a simulation
rootbrowse sim_output.root #look at simulation file with local ROOT build **outside the container**
ldmx python analysis.py sim_output.root #analyze the simulation file and produce PDF/PNG images of histograms
```

Notice that the `analysis.py` script, _even though it is not being run through fire_, is still run inside of the container. This is because the python-based analysis needs access to the ROOT dictionary for ldmx-sw which was generated by the container. _This is the only reason for analysis.py to be run inside the container._ If the `sim_output.root` file only has (for example) ntuples in it, then you could run your analysis outside the container because you don't need access to the ldmx-sw dictionary.

```
python analysis.py sim_output.root #this analysis uses the local ROOT install and does not need the ldmx-sw ROOT dictionary
```

*Conclusion:* The absolutely general protocol still uses an installation of ROOT that is outside of the container. You do not need installations of the other ldmx-sw dependencies and your installation of ROOT does not need to match the one inside of the container. 

### On macOS, I get a "invalid developer path" error when trying to use `git`.
On recent versions of the mac operating system, you need to re-install command line tools.
[This stackexchange question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280652/git-doesnt-work-on-macos-catalina-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path) outlines a simple solution.

### On macOS, I get a failure when I try to run the docker containers.
The default terminal on macOS is `tcsh`, but the environment setup script assumes that you are using `bash`. You should look at [this article](https://www.howtogeek.com/444596/how-to-change-the-default-shell-to-bash-in-macos-catalina/) for how to change your default shell to `bash` so that the ldmx environment script works.

### I can't compile and I get a "No such file or directory" error.
LDMX software is broken up into several different `git` repositories that are then pulled into a central repository _ldmx-sw_ as "submodules".
In order for you to get the code in the submodules, you need to tell `git` that you want it. There are two simple ways to do this.
1. You can re-clone the repository, but this time using the `--recursive` flag.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LDMX-Software/Framework.git
```
2. You can download the submodules after cloning _ldmx-sw_.
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Software complains about not being able to create a processor. (UnableToCreate)
This is almost always due to the library that contains that processor not being loaded.
We are trying to have the libraries automatically included by the python templates, 
but if you have found a python template that doesn't include the library you can do the following in the meantime.
```
# in your python configuration script
# p is a ldmxcfg.Process object you created earlier
p.libraries.append( 'libMODULE.so' )
# MODULE is the module that your processor is in (for example: Ecal, EventProc, or Analysis)
```

### Software complains about linking a library. (LibraryLoadFailure)
Most of the time, this is caused by the library not being found in the common search paths.
In order to make sure that the library can be found, you should give the full path to it.
```
# in your python configuration script
# p is a ldmxcfg.Process object you created earlier
p.libraries.append( '<full-path-to-ldmx-sw-install>/lib/libMODULE.so' )
# MODULE is the module that your processor is in (for example: Ecal, EventProc, or Analysis)
```

### ROOT version mismatch error.
This error looks something like this:
```
Error in <TUnixSystem::Load>: version mismatch, <full-path>/ldmx-sw/install/lib/libEvent.so = 62000, ROOT = 62004
```
This is caused by using one version of ROOT to compile _ldmx-sw_ and another one to use _ldmx-sw_,
and most people run into this issue when compiling _ldmx-sw_ inside of the container and then using _ldmx-sw_ outside of the container.
The fix to this is simple: **always compile and use _ldmx-sw_ inside of the container**. 
This makes sure that the dependencies never change.

If you need some dependency that isn't in your version of the container,
please file an [issue with the docker repository](https://github.com/LDMX-Software/docker/issues/new/choose) to request what's called a "derivative" container.

### Parameter 'className' does not exist in list of parameters.
This error usually occurs when you pass an object that isn't an EventProcessor as an EventProcessor to the Process sequence.
A feature that is helpful for debugging your configuration file is the `Process.pause` function:
```
# at the end of your config.py
p.pause() #prints your Process configuration and waits for you to press enter before continuing
```

### ldmx-sw cannot find the contents of a file when I _know_ that the file exists
Remember that you are running inside of the container, so the file you want to give to the software must be accessible by the container.
Some python features that are helpful for making sure the container can find your file are `os.path.fullpath` to get the full path to a file and
`os.path.isfile` to check that the file exists.
