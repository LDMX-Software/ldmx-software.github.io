      We include a link below in case the user's browser does not support this type of meta
      tag, in which case, they can click the link to open the manual in a new tab.
      Currently, we are hosting the Python Manual here, but this opens up the possibility
      of putting other software manuals in their own GitHub pages and then linking them here
      like this.
