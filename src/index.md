Welcome to the **L**ight **D**ark **M**atter e**X**periment!
This is the central page for documenting our software.
Here, you will find manually written documents as well as links to
other manuals related to the software. This site is generated using 
[mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) which has 
[a helpful page on how to read a site formatted like this](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/reading.html).
All of the pages are hosted here except for the pages in the **Reference** section
which are links to the manuals hosted at different sites.

Below is a list of past video tutorials that are available online. Some of them
may be out of date, but they can still be helpful in defining what kind
of vocabulary we often use. The first section of this manual is text-based information
about how to get started using (and eventually developing) ldmx-sw.
